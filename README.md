Define a MobiusStrip class that:
Accepts:
Radius R (distance from the center to the strip)
Width w (strip width)
Resolution n (number of points in the mesh)
Computes:
A 3D mesh/grid of (x, y, z) points on the surface
Surface area (numerically, using integration or approximation)
Edge length (numerically along the boundary)
